Simple Wordpress AdSense widget plugin

[Matching blog post here](http://mabboud.net/simple-wordpress-adsense-widget-plugin/) 

To install simply drop the aardvark-adsense folder into your plugins folder and then activate it from the WordPress Plugins UI. I’ll likely put it up on WordPress’s plugins listing when I polish the plugin up more.

From the widget form you enter in your Publisher ID and the ID of the ad you want to use. You can also modify the max height and width allowed for responsive ad units. Along with seperate max width and height fields for both mobile and desktop viewers.
